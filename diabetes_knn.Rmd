```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(reticulate)
use_virtualenv("root") #name the enviornment from conda to use
```

# Diabetes data

We begin by reading in diabetes data:

```{python}
import os
os.environ['QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH'] = 'C:/Users/0000/Anaconda3/Library/plugins/platforms'
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
